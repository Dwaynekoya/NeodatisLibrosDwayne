From the run menu, select edit configurations. In the dialog that appears, you will see a field for VM options. You
need to enter two options into this field with the following general form:

--module-path %PATH_TO_FX%
--add-modules=%FX_MODULES_NEEDED%
Instead of %PATH_TO_FX%, include the actual path to the JavaFX SDK lib directory. The path syntax will depend on your
operating system. For the example illustrated in the preceding steps, the first VM option would be:

--module-path "C:\Program Files\Java\javafx-sdk-11.0.2\lib"
The quote marks are necessary if you are using Windows since the name of one of the directories in the path contains a
space.

The JavaFX SDK is partitioned into seven modules. Include a comma-separated list of the ones your project will need in
 place of %FX_MODULES_NEEDED%. For example:

--add-modules=javafx.base,javafx.controls,javafx.graphics,javafx.media
Later you can add other modules if you need to, or remove some, by editing your run configuration again.

You can now run the application.
